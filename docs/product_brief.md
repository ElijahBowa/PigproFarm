# Product Brief â€” Pig Farm App

**Problem:** Paper-based records lead to missed vaccinations, wasted feed,
equipment failure, and poor traceability.

**Solution:** Offline-first desktop app that records pig identity, health events,
feed logs, and equipment maintenance with simple, low-literacy friendly UI.
Exports CSV and creates local backups.

**MVP success criteria:**
- Farmer can add a pig, record a vaccination, record a feed event.
- Notifications on due vaccinations/maintenance.
- Export CSV works.

**Users:** Smallholder pig farmers, farm workers, and local vets.

**Out of scope (Phase 0):** Cloud sync, hardware integrations.
